# Chrome-extension-template-setup-with-Reactjs-Typescript-and-Tailwind

This is a template to depelov browser extensions using **Reactjs**, **Tailwind** and **Typescript**. <br>
UPDATE:18/04/2024 Added a example to make clear how to create new tabs using react, you can find it in **src/form_example**,
once you have it installed in your browser you can go to any page **right click** anywhere to open the menu and you will see a option
called **Example Form** and it will open a new tab which one will ask for the title of the page/tab who opened it, you will clearly see it at the start.
**That's it, Thanks!**
